                VIRUSES
            </h1>
            <P>Definition: Tiny infectious agents that cannot survive or reproduce on their own; they need a host cell.
	•	Size: Usually 20–300 nanometers — way smaller than bacteria.
	•	Structure:
	•	Genetic material (DNA or RNA)
	•	Protein coat (capsid)
	•	Sometimes an outer lipid envelope

How they work:
	1.	Virus attaches to a host cell.
	2.	Injects its genetic material.
	3.	Hijacks the cell’s machinery to make new viruses.
	4.	Cell often dies or bursts, releasing new viruses.</P>
